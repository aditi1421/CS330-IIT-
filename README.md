# CS330-IIT-
Security Device Engine 
The purpose of this assignment is to get you to use Finite Automata concepts in solving real-life problems.

File cs330.py is the code for the first part. Access code is "22087". 
Unlock code is '220871' while the lock code is '220874'. Characters from 0-9 are accepted.
As soon as the last digit of the access code is entered, the program will signal the action taken (lock or unlock).

In the second part, randomgen.py randomly guesses the unlock code of the Security Device 20 times, and prints a 3-tuple (min, max, average) describing the minumum and maximum number of digits randomly generated until the passcode was guessed, and the average within all 20 times.
